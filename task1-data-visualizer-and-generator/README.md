The program is a simple web application built with streamlit, numpy and matplotlib that generates and visualizes random 2D data points (clusters) based on Gaussian distributions. 
Each class (0 (red) and 1 (blue)) has multiple modes and each mode has big enough sample points.


Users can customize the number of samples and modes (clusters) through sliders.

# Single Neuron Classifier

A Streamlit-based web app that simulates a trainable artificial neuron for binary classification.

## Features:
- Generates 2D data points for two classes (red and blue) using Gaussian distributions.
- Supports multiple activation functions: Heaviside, Logistic, Tanh, Sin, Sign, ReLU, and Leaky ReLU.
- Trains the neuron using gradient descent over user-defined epochs.
- Visualizes decision boundaries and classified data in real time.

## Customization Options:
- Number of samples and modes (clusters) per class.
- Learning rate, epochs, and activation function via an interactive sidebar.

## Overview

This project demonstrates fundamental AI concepts through practical tasks. These tasks encompass data visualization, training machine learning models, neural network backpropagation, implementing search algorithms, and designing a fuzzy logic controller for a game. The implementations prioritize GUI-based interactivity and visualization using Python tools.
